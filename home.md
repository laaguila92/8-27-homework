hello. This is Joseph Pena, as i'm sure you know. the assignment was to tell you about our favrite hobbies, and mine is to play baseball as ive been doing it since i was 4 years old and love the game immensly. but i'm sure the pint of this exercise is not to tell you about our favorite hobby. rather, it is to show you that we can create and modify the appropriate file, so i will not bore you with the details. Go Yankees
